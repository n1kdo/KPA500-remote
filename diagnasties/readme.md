# Diagnasties

These are some diagnostic applications I wrote to help me reverse engineer
the network wire protocol used by the KPA-500 and KAT-500 remote software 
packages, in order that my KPA-500 remote software could emulate the servers
provided by those packages. 

I also examined the RS-232 wire data as well; though it was all documented
in the manuals, learning what data is exchanged between the remote applications
and the hardware (amp and tuner) allowed me to better emulate the servers.

As far as I can tell, using the N1KDO KPA500-remote software running on 
Micropython is indistiguishable from the "real" Elecraft server code.
